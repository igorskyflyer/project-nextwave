### Welcome to NextWave! ðŸŒŠ

ðŸŒŠ Project NextWave: A living log of a largeâ€‘scale npm username/package scope migration sparked by technical issues, engineered for reproducibility, minimal disruption, and ecosystem trust. ðŸš€

<br>

### Why NextWave?

This migration was prompted by a longâ€‘standing Windowsâ€‘specific compatibility issue affecting npm package scopes that contain a dot (.).

<br>

> [!TIP]
> See more about the issue in the [official discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169922).
>

<br>

While such scopes are valid per the [npm specification](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file#required-name-and-version-fields):

>
> A package.json file must contain "`name`" and "`version`" fields.
>
> The "`name`" field contains your package's name and must be lowercase without any spaces. May contain hyphens, dots, and underscores.
>

they can fail in modern Windows environments due to PowerShell parsing quirks and crossâ€‘platform path resolution edge cases. These inconsistencies disrupt installs and build pipelines, creating friction for maintainers and consumers alike. Project NextWave documents the full remediation process: from planning to execution, turning a oneâ€‘time fix into a reproducible blueprint other projects can adapt with minimal disruption.

## Progress

Follow along in the [official tracker](https://github.com/igorskyflyer/project-nextwave/milestone/1) as we check off packages, close out subâ€‘issues, and move steadily towards a fully migrated, crossâ€‘platformâ€‘safe ecosystem.
